## Introduction

This project contains a small program which highlights the core concept of 'pass by value' in Java technology. The core explanation is as follows:
```
/**
		 * The values are printed as a1:test1 and a2:test2
		 * This is because in a1 contains the address 0xABCD
		 *                    a2 contains the address 0xEFGH
		 * after swapping	  a1 contains the address 0xEFGH
		 * and 	              a2 contains the address 0xABCD     
		 * but when we set animal1.name="test2";then basically
		 * 						0xEFGH contains value test2
		 * 						0xABCD contains value test1
		 * Hence, we are getting:
		 * After Swap:- a1:test1; a2:test2
		 * 
		 */
